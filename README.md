## Overview

The Spotify Playlist Bake application is a React front-end which uses the Spotify Open Web API to generate user playlists. Users can select seed artists and manage audio feature settings to create and save custom playlists. The goal of the site is to give direct access to the track attributes, audio parameters and seed data that are used within the Spotify recommendation engine system. Rather than obfuscating these parameters into general questions or making black-box decisions, the site allows more audiophillic users to fine-tune and tweak recomendation parameters to create meticulously curated playlists.
